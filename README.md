### Introduction
PetSmart is a smart pet collar that is waterproof and a wearable device. You need to wear it on your pet and connect it to your PC or mobile phone. You can track your pet and also get the location histories, analyze your pet’s sleep, measure the temperature and pulse of your pet, and track the pet’s vaccination time.
